# MHRAuto
An automatic script and img processing tool for mhr qurious crafting
It was once designed for PC.
But by using reframework we can just call the function in game.
It is so fast and reliable.
There are no incorrect items here.
So it is useless.

But I find it may be useful for NS players.

Use script or programmable handle,players can easily do qurious crafting automaticly and get the screenshot.
Then use the img processing tool(img2csv),get the information form img,and write the information as a csv file.

I am doing sth to support multi language.but ocr model i just trained zh_CN
you can trained other language by your self
